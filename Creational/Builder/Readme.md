# Builder
\- Binf.  
\- Binf?  
\- Yes, Binf.  
\- Ok... But... What is Binf?  
\- Builder is not Fluent.

> I am so sorry about that...

I don't know whether this expression was sometimes used or not for someone, but I put here to remind you that Builder and Fluent are different concepts. I did it because there is a lot of people that think that Builder and Fluent are the same, but, believe me, they are not.

**The Builder Pattern is about how can you construct a complex object.**  

Fluent, in another hand, is more like a Facade where you can join different objects in a more readable way. Like Entity Framework, for example! =)

So, in this source you will find a compelxo solution for a simple problem for rearning reasons. The goal here is to make you understand how to implement this pattern for when you need it in a real complex situation.
