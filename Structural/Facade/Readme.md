# Facade
I like seeing some aeroplane videos and, in one of these days, I saw a pilot saying that piloting an A380 is pretty much the same as piloting an a318.

Just for comparison:

And the reason is exactly what the Facade pattern proposes: To give a simplified interface to complex algorithms.

The cockpit from both aeroplanes are too similar because they share the same philosophy, the same "Facade". What happens behind this... Well... I don't have to be worried about. I am a pilot, not an engineer.

> Of course, pilots have a sense of how things work, but this is not the case here.

Although the cockpit is a good Facade for pilots, it is not for us.  
With this in mind, I chose to make a **PilotFacade** in order to ask him to take off the aeroplane =)
