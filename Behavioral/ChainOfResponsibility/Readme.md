# Chain of Responsibility
You can use Chain of Responsibility in order to avoid a big amount of "ifs" in your code.  
It is good when you know that the number of operations can increase or even when you want to delegate parts of some complex job to some classes.  
It turns your code into a more clean, readable and organized one.

In the source code, you will find a solution for a calculator that can in the future has complex operations and solve math expressions, for example.

## Bonus
You can also find here an implementation of the Null Object Pattern. Take a look!
