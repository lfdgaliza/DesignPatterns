# Observer

Please, when you need to check the status of something to make some action, don't be like Donkey:

Don't you think that it would be better and less aggressive to the infrastructure to be advised when something changes rather than asking every second (or whatever the arbitrary time you choose) if something changes?

For that reason, the Observable pattern exists.

Of course, you can develop the entire pattern, but the dotnet already has some useful interfaces to boost your productivity. So, do not reinvent the wheel here unless you want to implement something more specialized.

Remember that the patterns are not an absolute rule. It is recommended that you use some well-known pattern into your code, but know the rules to know how to break them when needed, ok?
