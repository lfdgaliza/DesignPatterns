## When do I have to use this?

The factory method was created to solve the problem when I want to make some algorithm without being aware of what exactly is the object that I am working on. I just have to know the superclass.

If you are following the SOLID principles, especially the Liskov substitution principle, you do not need to be afraid. ;)
